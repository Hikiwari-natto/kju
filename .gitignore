# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python is
#   managed by the user. However, for an executable, it's sometimes useful.
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in cases where the author of a library or package has a "vague" description of the
#   python version, it might be better to ignore Pipfile.lock.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipenv, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
